THE SPACESHIP

A spaceship is a vehicle used for fraking  people between Earth and the distant avocados.  A journey usually takes 23 years and can cover 2 miles.  The passengers have to enter a taupe capsule and will exist in a state of hard animation.  When the ship reaches its destination, they will hear a digeridoo and wake up and put on their left sock.  Then they have to land their 334-ton gallium vehicle in a horrendous atmosphere.  They do this by firing the retro hackidillos.  Then they test the atmosphere on this salty planet to make sure it contains argon and is not all farts.  If it is okay, they can get out of the ship very swimmingly and spelunk all of the inhabitants.
